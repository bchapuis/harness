//! The sandbox seam (harness spec §5.3): isolated execution environments.
//!
//! The third harness seam, and the isolation boundary of §5.1: every declared
//! tool except the built-in `delegate` executes inside its session's sandbox
//! and nowhere else. The spec mandates *that* effects run behind this seam,
//! not *how*: process, container, or microVM is the provider's secret (§1.1);
//! the simulator's scripted sandbox is one more implementation of the same
//! trait (§12.1).
//!
//! A sandbox is **working state, not session state** (§5.5): the fold never
//! reads it, no record depends on its contents, and losing it never loses the
//! session — the loss surfaces to the model as a journaled `WorkspaceReset`,
//! never as silent corruption (invariant H8).
