//! Harness observability events (harness spec §10.4): checker-facing,
//! ephemeral, describing the *machinery around* sessions — run pairing, model
//! spend, the sandbox bind/release pair — so the H-invariants are checkable over
//! a run's stream. They carry nothing about a session's content: records are the
//! durable, user-facing account (§10.1). Activation, deactivation, and the
//! single-writer fence are the grain's events (`Activated`/`Passivated`/
//! `LeaderChanged`, granary §13), not duplicated here.
//!
//! The vocabulary is the harness's; the stream is the framework's: each
//! event rides the core stream as [`Event::App`] (core spec §16), so
//! checkers observe one totally ordered sequence interleaved with the core
//! events, and the seed-reproducibility contract (core spec §18.1 #1) covers
//! these for free. Recover them with `event.as_app::<HarnessEvent>()`.
