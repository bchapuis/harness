//! The transport trait (spec §7).
//!
//! A [`Transport`] is the pluggable *mechanism* that carries [`Frame`]s between
//! nodes — the default TCP transport and the simulator's in-memory network are
//! two implementations of one trait, indistinguishable from above (spec §7). The
//! frames it carries — the wire *protocol* — live in [`crate::protocol`], so the
//! carrier stays decoupled from any subsystem's payload.
