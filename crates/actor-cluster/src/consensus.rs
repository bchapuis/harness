//! The application consensus seam (spec §9.4.3).
//!
//! [`RaftLog`] is the narrow capability a layer built *on* the cluster — granary's
//! sharded journal — needs from a Raft-hosting [`ClusterSystem`](crate::ClusterSystem):
//! create an application group, propose opaque command bytes to its leader, and
//! observe the committed stream. It is the consensus analogue of granary's own
//! `GranarySystem` seam: it lets that crate stay generic over `R: RaftLog`
//! instead of naming the concrete `ClusterSystem<C, E, S, T>` and its four type
//! parameters.
//!
//! It is used as a **generic bound** (`R: RaftLog`), never as `dyn RaftLog`, so
//! the `impl Future` / concrete-`Receiver` return types are fine — no object
//! safety is required and the futures are never boxed on the hot path.
